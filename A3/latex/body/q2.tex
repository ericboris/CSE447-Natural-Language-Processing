{\bf 2.}
Continuing in the style of problem 1, consider this model:

\begin{equation}
    \textrm{score}(w_1, ..., w_m) = \mathbb{\theta} \cdot \textrm{ReLU} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \mathbf{x}_{w_i} \right)
\end{equation}

Show that, in this case, it is possible to achieve the inequalities (2–3). 
The recommended way to do this is to provide weights $\mathbb{\theta}$ and embeddings for the words good, bad, and not. 
The problem can be solved with four dimensions. \\
Hint: problems 1 and 2 are related to the “XOR” problem (2) from assignment 2.
