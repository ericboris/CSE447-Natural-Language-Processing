	$$ \heartsuit_i (y', y) = \max_{y'' \in \mathcal{L}} s(\textbf{x}, i-1, y'', y', y') + \heartsuit_{i-1} (y'', y') $$
	$$ b_i (y', y) = \arg\!\max_{y'' \in \mathcal{L}} s(\textbf{x}, i-1, y'', y', y') + b_{i-1} (y'', y') $$

In general, the space and time complexity of Viterbi grows exponentially. Space complexity grows to $\mathcal{O}(\ell * | L |^2)$ because there are exponentially many more label history combinations to store. In the case of time complexity, each label must now be examined twice. So, since we had $\mathcal{O} (\ell * | L |^2)$ in the bigram model, we grow exponentially to $\mathcal{O} (\ell * | L |^4)$ for the trigram model.
