\section{Results}

Below are listed the results of one particular run of the Sentiment Lexicon classifier and the Logistic Regression Classifier. Over many runs, the Accuracy and F1 scores on the Sentiment Lexicon and Logistic Regression classifiers hover around 70\% and 80\%, respectively. 

\subsection*{Sentiment Lexicon}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accuracy: 0.7425
    \item F1: 0.7379
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Logistic Regression}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accuracy: 0.8025
    \item F1: 0.8256
\end{itemize}
