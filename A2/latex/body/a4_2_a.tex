    \textbf{Linear Interpolation n-Gram Model}
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Given an $n>1$, build n k-Gram models where $1\leq k \leq n$ such as those described above.
    \item For each token $t_i$ in the nth k-Gram model compute the linear interpolation smoothing using the formula described above.
\end{itemize}
