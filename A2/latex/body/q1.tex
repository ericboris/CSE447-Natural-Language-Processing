\textbf{1}. Consider a simple language in which each token is drawn from the vocabulary $V$ with probability $\frac{1}{\vert V \vert}$, independent of all other tokens. Given a corpus of size $M$, what is the expectation of the fraction of all possible bigrams that have zero count? You may assume $V$ is large enough that $\frac{1}{\vert V \vert} \approx \frac{1}{\vert V \vert - 1}$.
